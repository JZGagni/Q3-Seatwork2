			    <td>Teppei is a member of the Watatsumi Army that fought against the Raiden Shogun's oppressive rule and Vision Hunt Decree. He first served in the logistics division before being sent to the front lines and assigned to the Gobius Platoon. But after the effects of the Delusion (given by the Fatui before the battle against the Shogun Navy), he soon succumbed and died.</td>

			    <td>Melus is the older of Navia's two attendants. During the events of Deluge of Wrathful Waters, Melus was dissolved by the Primordial Sea while trying to save other people when the water began flooding Poisson. His consciousness was forged into an Oceanid, where he and Silver protected Navia from the collective of other Poisson victims after she nearly fell into the water, who wanted to absorb her consciousness. The act was long enough for Neuvillette to save her from being completely dissolved, where he gave his final farewell to her.</td>

			    <td>Ruu was the child of the last priest, Mata, of Tsurumi Island, and from a young age, he studied Ishine Script under Mata's guidance. Ruu enjoyed spending time with the other villagers. He was also fond of singing, although he was somewhat embarrassed about it and often went off into the fog to sing alone. His singing captivated the local deity, the Thunderbird, who originally paid no mind to the island's people. However, Ruu was not intimidated by the guardian, and they talked briefly, with Ruu giving her the name "Kanna Kapatcir." They promised to meet each other again in the future.</td>

She was hired along with her father by Tirzad to investigate some ruins in the desert, although they fell into a sinkhole and were only found by the Traveler after Bonifaz was worried about their status. She quickly befriended the Traveler, and while trying to find a way out, she discovered an unusual Primal Construct and befriended it, giving it the name Benben.</td>

			    <td>Jebrael was a member of the Eremites who used to live in the desert. He was originally part of the Tanit tribe. Both Jebrael and Samail were part of an expedition team sent by Babel to explore the ruins of Gurabad. Babel's true plan included eliminating adherents of King Deshret,[3] so she also hid a mole within the expedition team, Tarafa, tasked to assassinate the entire team. Jebrael faked his own death and struck down Tarafa before he could target Samail, leaving Samail and Jebrael as the only survivors. The two left the Tanit tribe afterward, which irritated Babel and led Jebrael to be considered a traitor to the tribe.  </td>
